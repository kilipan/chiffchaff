# Chiffchaff
*An unholy mixture of Zilpzalp and Chiffre*

\[W.I.P. repo, use at your own risk\]

## Firmware
Chiffchaff uses the CH552T MCU and thus runs FAK (or your personal homebrew firmware) only. The config can be found [here](https://github.com/kilipan/fak-config/tree/main/keyboards/chiffchaff).
